# tap-node-c5

A myrmic firmware for the esp32c5 with a Signal Layer pipeline.

## Layout

- `board.yml` - the hardware: buses, the GPIOs offered to the cell, and the
  devices on the buses.
- `pipeline.yml` - the Signal Layer: sources (reading devices), steps
  (processing), and taps (values the cell reads).
- `src/main.rs` - brings up the node and starts the pipeline. The generated
  pipeline code is pulled in by `esp_firmware::pipeline!()`.
- `build.rs` - generates the pipeline from `board.yml` + `pipeline.yml` at build
  time, into `$OUT_DIR`.

The starter pipeline uses `sim-source`, a synthetic sensor, so it builds and
runs with no hardware attached.

## Build and flash

```sh
myrmic build .
myrmic flash .
```

## Change the pipeline

Edit `board.yml` and `pipeline.yml`, then rebuild. Every driver and step shipped
with myrmic is already available as a dependency; swap `sim-source` for a real
sensor and add sources, steps and taps as needed. If the board's `chip` and the
build's chip feature disagree, or the pipeline names a crate that is not a
dependency, the build fails with a message naming the fix.

To use a driver or step you wrote yourself, add its crate to `[dependencies]`
and the `pipeline` feature, then point the build at its descriptors:

```rust
// build.rs
esp_firmware_build::pipeline()
    .board("board.yml")
    .pipeline("pipeline.yml")
    .include("descriptors") // drivers/<id>/descriptor.yaml, steps/<id>/descriptor.yaml
    .generate();
```
